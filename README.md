# Results, runscripts, and benchmarks for the paper "Knowledge Compilation and More with SharpSAT-TD"
## Benchmarks
The benchmarks for pure CNF to sd-DNNF compilation are from https://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/KC/benchmarks.html. 
We did not include the `Handmade` instance, which seemed to include some formatting problems.

The benchmarks for CNF to sd-DNNF compilation in the presence of auxiliary (and defined) variables are in the folder `aux_benchmarks`. 
They include an annotation of the form `c p weight <V> <V> 0` and `c p weight -<V> -<V> 0` for every variable that is *not* defined.
## Runscripts
The runscripts `compile.py` and `aux_compile.py` were used to perform pure CNF to sd-DNNF compilation and compilation in the presence of auxiliary variables, respectively.
They require the python module `aspmc` (version 1.0.9 was used in our experiments), which includes the used knowledge compilation tools.
They accept one command line argument which specifies the knowledge compiler to be used and a second argument which specifies the CNF to be compiled.
## Results
The raw data is included in the files `results/KC_basic.xml` and `results/KC_aux.xml`.
The plots used in the paper (and more) can be generated by running
```
cd results
python plot.py
python plot_aux.py
```
